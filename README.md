# FDM Additive Manufacturing Online Monitoring
## XJTU Datasets and Publications

This website showcases the research achievements of **Professor Chen's group** at Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU) in the field of **Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) additive manufacturing monitoring**. The webpage systematically presents three significant academic publications covering the complete technical roadmap from transfer learning and multi-view monitoring to multimodal large models.

## Research Overview

Our research group has developed comprehensive solutions for intelligent monitoring and quality control in FDM 3D printing processes. The work spans multiple cutting-edge technologies:

- **Transfer Learning Framework** for domain shift mitigation
- **Multi-view Deep Information Fusion** for enhanced defect detection
- **Multimodal Large Model** integration for advanced process monitoring

## Publications Featured

### 1. Transfer Learning for Domain Shift Mitigation
